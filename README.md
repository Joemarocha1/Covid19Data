# Covid19Data
Analysis of Covid19 Data in various regions of the USA

This Python script analyzes COVID-19 death data by province in the U.S. using a CSV file (usa_county_wise.csv) containing information on confirmed cases and deaths. The script loads the data with pandas, filters it for five specific provinces (Florida, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York), and calculates the total confirmed cases and deaths for each province. The results are printed to the console, and a bar chart is generated using matplotlib to visualize the total deaths per province. The script also includes axis labels, a title, and gridlines for better readability of the graph. Make sure to update the file path to the correct location of your CSV file.
